# Lovesong-Generator-Challenge
Used PyTorch to implement a Character RNN to generate a lovesong based on a dataset given + kaggle's dataset.

Sample lovesong generated:
```Hanikation  
And the stars are shaking down on you again  
I'm a love like a shame  
I wanna be your lovin' way  
  
I want the world and I want you  
And if I'm always with you  
I want to be loved  
I'm in love with you  
I wanna feel what love is  
I know I know you can show me  
I wanna feel what love is  
I'll do anything you want to make me cry  
I don't want to be with you more than your lovin' way  
I want you to share my love with you  
  
I want to show you what love is if you want me  
I don't want you to stop my life  
  
You can take me away  
I'm not trying not to leave your faith in me  
I'm goin' a little longer  
I can't believe that I could never find  
I didn't know I'm always wrong  
  
And I'm so in love with you  
I want your love tonight  
I will always stop the world  
To be with you and I can't live without  
I wanna feel you  
I'll buy you a little baby  
I'll be your life and tell you that I don't wanna be  
I don't want you to stop and tell you that I'm a little bit of mind  
  
[Chorus]  
I love to love ya  
I love you  
  
I'm a lonely one  
And I want to share it with you  
I don't want to
